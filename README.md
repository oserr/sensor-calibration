# Sensor Calibration
A project for *18-847: Wireless Software Systems Architecture* at Carnegie
Mellon University.

## Purpose
The explosion of wireless devices has created new opportunities to enhance
security protocols by leveraging sensor data in wireless devices, but a key
challenge in using sensor data from multiple devices is the fact that wireless
devices rarely share the same orientation, making it difficult to correlate
data from multiple devices. Therefore, we explore sensor calibration techniques
to solve this problem.

## Misc Notes
* PowerDue has MPU\_9250, which has a gyroscope and accelerometer.
* The SparkFun library for the sensor can be updated with the correct address
  to work with MPU\_9250. The address is 0b1101000.
