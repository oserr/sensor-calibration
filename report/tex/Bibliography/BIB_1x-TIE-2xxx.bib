    title = {Deep learning},
    abstract = {Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%----------------------------------------Fields---------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%address
                %Usually the address of the publisher or other type of institution.
%annote
                %An annotation. It is not used by the standard bibliography styles, but may be used by others that produce an annotated bibliography.
%author
                %The name(s) of the author(s), in the format described in the LaTeX book.
%booktitle
                %Title of a book, part of which is being cited. See the LaTeX book for how to type titles. For book entries, use the title field instead.
%chapter
                %A chapter (or section or whatever) number.
%crossref
                %The database key of the entry being cross referenced. Any fields that are missing from the current record are inherited from the field being cross referenced.
%edition
                %The edition of a book---for example, ``Second''. This should be an ordinal, and should have the first letter capitalized, as shown here; the standard styles convert to lower case when necessary.
%editor
                %Name(s) of editor(s), typed as indicated in the LaTeX book. If there is also an author field, then the editor field gives the editor of the book or collection in which the reference appears.
%howpublished
                %How something strange has been published. The first word should be capitalized.
%institution
                %The sponsoring institution of a technical report.
%journal
                %A journal name. Abbreviations are provided for many journals.
%key
                %Used for alphabetizing, cross referencing, and creating a label when the ``author'' information is missing. This field should not be confused with the key that appears in the cite command and at the beginning of the database entry.
%month
                %The month in which the work was published or, for an unpublished work, in which it was written. You should use the standard three-letter abbreviation, as described in Appendix B.1.3 of the LaTeX book.
%note
                %Any additional information that can help the reader. The first word should be capitalized.
%number
                %The number of a journal, magazine, technical report, or of a work in a series. An issue of a journal or magazine is usually identified by its volume and number; the organization that issues a technical report usually gives it a number; and sometimes books are given numbers in a named series.
%organization
                %The organization that sponsors a conference or that publishes a manual.
%pages
                %One or more page numbers or range of numbers, such as 42--111 or 7,41,73--97 or 43+(the `+' in this last example indicates pages following that don't form a simple range). To make it easier to maintain Scribe-compatible databases, the standard styles convert a single dash (as in 7-33) to the double dash used in TeX to denote number ranges (as in 7--33).
%publisher
                %The publisher's name.
%school
                %The name of the school where a thesis was written.
%series
                %The name of a series or set of books. When citing an entire book, the the title field gives its title and an optional series field gives the name of a series or multi-volume set in which the book is published.
%title
                %The work's title, typed as explained in the LaTeX book.
%type
                %The type of a technical report---for example, ``Research Note''.
%volume
                %The volume of a journal or multi-volume book.
%year
                %The year of publication or, for an unpublished work, the year it was written. Generally it should consist of four numerals, such as 1984, although the standard styles can handle any year whose last four nonpunctuation characters are numerals, such as `\hbox{(about 1984)}'.
%affiliation
                %The authors affiliation.
%abstract
                %An abstract of the work.
%contents
                %A Table of Contents

%ISBN
                %The International Standard Book Number.
%ISSN
                %The International Standard Serial Number. Used to identify a journal.
%keywords
                %Key words used for searching or possibly for annotation.

                %The language the document is in.
%location
                %A location associated with the entry, such as the city in which a conference took place.
%LCCN
                %The Library of Congress Call Number. I've also seen this as lib-congress.
%mrnumber
                %The Mathematical Reviews number.
%price
                %The price of the document.
%size
                %The physical dimensions of a work.
%URL
                %The WWW Universal Resource Locator that points to the item being referenced. This often is used for technical reports to point to the ftp site where the postscript source of the report is located.
