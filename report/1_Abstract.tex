\emph{The abstract needs to provide the reader with a succinct summary of the paper.  It should present the key challenge that you, as the writer, faced in doing the work you will describe, and it should do so in a way that makes the work relevant to the reader.  It should then present the key claim or claims you are making along with key supporting evidence.  Conclude the abstract with a statement of relevance.  In this case:}

This report investigates the correlation of air-speed velocity with weight of the typical African swallow. By releasing the swallow at a well-defined location with a variety of weights and carefully measuring transit time of flight between the release point and an established \emph{bait target}, we can accurately determine the relationship. Through careful analysis across hundreds of trials, we can confidently assert an inverse square-law relationship between weight and speed.  As the African swallow is an exemplar of many other species, we postulate that this work can be generalized to other similar birds.
