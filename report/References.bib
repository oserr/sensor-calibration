@inproceedings{Athreya2014,
abstract = {Connected embedded systems in the realm of smart infrastructures comprise ubiquitous end-point devices supported by a communication infrastructure. Device, energy supply and network failures are a reality and provisioned communications could fail. Self-organization is a process where network devices cooperate with each other to restore network connectivity on detecting network connectivity failures. Self-organized networks are envisioned to be hierarchical, implying that a root device is expected to spend more energy to forward the entire network’s data. This leads to battery exhaustion and therefore a single point of failure in the system. In this paper we address this problem by proposing an energy-governed resilient networking framework. Our framework enforces a policy to throttle upstream network traffic to maintain energy drain at the root device. To demon- strate the effectiveness of the proposed policy, we designed our experiment framework using Nano-RK and FireFly; a lightweight operating system and sensing platform respectively.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) aims to integrate the digital world of the Internet with our encompassing physical world. However, existing IoT systems do not pro- vide considerate services, meaning that sensors dynamically “collaborate” to provide context-aware federated sensor data, tuned to human needs. This paper reports our on-going work developing a sensor service federation and provision- ing infrastructure. A novel approach is presented to build social sensor networks to record and study historical interac- tion patterns among sensors. Workflow provenance is car- ried by a dynamic virtual device concept that we have intro- duced. A case study describes how to leverage an in- memory database to monitor and manage real-time sensor service provisioning.},

	title = {Predictors of household disaster preparedness in {California}: {Findings} from a statewide telephone survey},
	url = {http://www.colorado.edu/hazards/awards/paper-competition/kelley.pdf},
	abstract = {Background: The impact of disasters on public health is significant and multifaceted. One means of reducing the impact of disasters is adopting emergency preparedness practices to decrease vulnerability and improve resilience. The goal of this analysis was to identify predictors of preparedness behavior, explore a theory-driven mechanism through which households prepare and examine whether preparedness behavior differed between race/ethnic groups or geographic areas in California households.
Methods: A statewide random-digit-dialing telephone survey was conducted with 2,081 California residents 18 years of age and older. Descriptive and inferential statistics were utilized to examine the dependent variable, preparedness actions. The independent variables tested, included the exogenous constructs of status (operationalized with income, education, gender and race/ethnicity), roles (operationalized with partnership and number of dependents) and disaster experience. The endogenous constructs tested were information types, information sources, information channels, cues and milling.

Results: A comprehensive model of disaster preparedness actions was developed. All of the variables remained statistically significant, except race/ethnicity, marital status, disaster experience and number of dependent children. Overall, the comprehensive model accounted for 54\% of the variance in disaster preparedness actions reported in the survey. Effect modification was observed with interaction terms for geographic risk and race/ethnicity, however, this disappeared with subgroup analysis, which may have been an effect of sample size.

Conclusion: The proposed model contributes to the expansion of our understanding by presenting a causal mechanism for preparedness behavior. In turn, this mechanism has the ability to inform disaster research agendas and policy to reduce their impact.},
