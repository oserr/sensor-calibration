\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Setting up a system to be event-driven can be challenging because it requires
very close cooperation between the hardware-software interface, there are
subtleties around the behavior of interrupt handlers, and the hardware
configuration and code can be more complex; however, such an architecture can be
essential for wireless embedded systems, in particular WSNs, which are expected
to run a long time without getting battery replacements.

Ultimately, setting up the PowerDue and FXOS8700CQ to be event-driven results in
a system that is more power efficient and accurate, because it allows the
PowerDue CPU to remain in the idle state for longer periods of time, and to be
more accurate, because we avoid the cost of missed events while the system is
sleeping waiting to make its next poll.
